## Installation
You can download the latest release for your platform of choice from the [releases page](https://github.com/arnaud-ritti/clickup-timer/releases)

### Setup credentials
When starting the app for the first time you are asked to fill in some credentials. You'll need these two:

#### ClickUp Access token
Log in to ClickUp & click on your profile pic in the bottom left. Then click `Apps`.

In the next screen you'll see a button to generate a API token. Do that and paste the output in the ClickUp Timer app's preferences.

#### ClickUp Team ID
You can find your team's ID in the url after you log in to your ClickUp dashboard. It's the first part after the domain. For example if you see `app.clickup.com/1234567`, then your team ID is `1234567`
