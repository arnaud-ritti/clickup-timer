## Reporting a Vulnerability

1.  This project relies on [Electron][1] for most of its features.
    If you suspect that the security issue is caused by Electron, please report
    the issue to them as explained in [Electron's repo][2]

2.  If you find truly critical security issues (e.g. a way to bypass the
    restricted access to the admin) you can report them to my private email
    address at `arnaud.ritti@gmail.com`.
